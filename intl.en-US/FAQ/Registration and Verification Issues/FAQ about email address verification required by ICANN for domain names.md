# FAQ about email address verification required by ICANN for domain names

This topic provides answers to commonly asked questions about the email address verification policy of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers \(ICANN\) for domain names.

## What is the email address verification policy of ICANN for domain names?

As the rule maker and supervisor of the domain name industry, ICANN requires that domain name registration information \(WHOIS information\) be authentic and complete and that registrants' email addresses be authentic. A domain name registrar formulates audit policies and processes in accordance with relevant ICANN rules to ensure business compliance and promote the normal and smooth development of the entire domain name industry. For more information, see [ICANN WHOIS ACCURACY PROGRAM SPECIFICATION](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/approved-with-specs-2013-09-17-en#whois-accuracy).

## How does Alibaba Cloud implement the compliance policy of ICANN?

-   To register a domain name, you must select a registrant profile for which an email address has been verified. If the email address is not verified, the registrant profile cannot be used for domain name registration.
-   To modify domain name information, including changes to the domain name registrant, administrative, technical, and billing contact information, make sure that the email address of the domain name registrant has been verified. Otherwise, you cannot continue the subsequent operations.
-   To transfer domain names to Alibaba Cloud, modify information for multiple domain names, or conduct domain name transactions, you must select a registrant profile for which an email address has been verified. If the email address is not verified, you cannot continue the subsequent operations.

## How do I verify an email address?

For more information, see [Verify the email address of a domain holder](/intl.en-US/Domain name management/Verify the email address of a domain holder.md).

## How long does it take to verify an email address?

After you submit the verification request, log on to the email server and click the link in the verification email that is received. The email address will be verified immediately. You must verify the email address within three days after you submit the request. After three days, the verification link will expire and you must submit another request for verification.

## How can I handle a domain name that is in the Clienthold state because no email address is verified for the domain name?

As the domain name registrant, after you verify an email address for the domain name, the **Clienthold** state is automatically removed.

## Do I need to verify an email address again after it has been verified?

After an email address is verified, you do not need to verify it again, unless you have deleted it from the verification information of your domain name. An email address can be verified only once under a single Alibaba Cloud account. However, you can verify the same email address for multiple times across multiple Alibaba Cloud accounts.

## Is there any limit on the number of email addresses that I can verify?

No. However, a single Alibaba Cloud account supports the verification of up to 500 email addresses every day.

## After I delete a verified email address, do I need to verify it again when I use it to register a domain name?

Yes. If your verified email address is deleted, you must verify the email address again when you use it to register a domain name or modify the domain name information.

## Why do I have a verified email address though I have not submitted any email verification requests?

To improve user experience, we have imported your email address that have been verified in other Alibaba Cloud scenarios. The verified email address does not need to be verified again. For example, if an email address has been verified for a domain name under an Alibaba Cloud account, this email address does not need to be verified again in other scenarios when you use the same Alibaba Cloud account.

## What can I do if I fail to receive an email for verification?

Check whether the email address that you specify is valid and can normally receive and send other emails. If other emails can be normally received and sent, you can troubleshoot the problem based on the following table.

|Possible cause|Solution|
|--------------|--------|
|The email address is configured with rejection.|Cancel the rejection setting.|
|The verification email is identified as a spam.|Check whether the verification email is in the spam folder.|
|Certain mailboxes automatically classify notification emails that are received. The verification email is distributed to another folder.|Check all folders of the mailbox.|
|You specify a QQ email address, which may fail to receive the verification email sent by Alibaba Cloud.|Use another email address for verification.|

## What can I do if I cannot open the email verification link that I receive?

After a verification email is received, you must log on to your email server and click the link in the verification email within three days. If you cannot open the email verification link in the email, you can copy this link to a browser and open it. If the link expires, you must send another verification request and complete the verification.
