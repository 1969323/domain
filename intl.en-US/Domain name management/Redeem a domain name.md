# Redeem a domain name

After a domain name expires, a 30-day grace period is provided for renewal. When the grace period ends, the domain name enters the redemption period. Domain names with different suffixes have different redemption periods. You need to pay a higher price to redeem your domain name within the redemption period. This topic describes how to redeem a domain name.

The renewal grace period of the domain name ends, and the domain name is in its redemption period.

## Procedure

To make sure that your domain name can be properly used, renew your domain name before it expires. This prevents extra payment for redemption. If you do not renew a domain name within the renewal grace period, the domain name enters the redemption period. Perform the following steps to redeem a domain name:

**Note:**

-   When a domain name enters the redemption period, the costs of redeeming the domain name from the domain name registry are much higher than the costs of registering or renewing the domain name. For more information about the redemption prices of domain names, see [t14309.md\#section\_n3z\_znv\_12b](/intl.en-US/Pricing/Domain name fees.md).
-   During the redemption period, DNS resolution is suspended. DNS resolution is immediately resumed when the domain name is redeemed. However, you must reset the DNS records of the domain name. The resolution recovery usually takes 24 to 48 hours to take effect.

1.  Log on to the [Alibaba Cloud Domains console](https://dc.console.aliyun.com).

2.  On the **Domain Names** page, click the **To Be Redeemed** tab.

    **Note:** If you cannot find your domain name on the **To Be Redeemed** tab, the domain name may have been deleted by the domain name registry because the redemption period has ended.

3.  Select the domain names that you want to redeem. In the lower part of the domain name list, select **Bulk Redeem**

4.  Complete the domain name redemption as prompted.
